			<p>Hello, my name is Peter Watters.	I took an unusual path to a career in programming- 
				I received a full scholarship to Washington University in St Louis for Painting. After graduating with a BFA, 
				I spent the next six years working as a Printer - I was printing the original DOS manuals for Microsoft in the early 1980's.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I began taking mathematics classes at the University of Washington in preparation for a degree in Engineering.
				I took a class in Fortran to fulfil a prerequisite and found that I loved programming.  
				I was eager to start so I signed up for the Boeing Computer Services' nine month technical 
				school for business programming and began my career at Boeing. I worked there eight years.</p><br/>
			<p>For the last 19 years I have been a software developer at 
				<a href="http://www.avst.com" target="_blank">Applied Voice and Speech Technologies</a>.
				I worked on the 
				<a href="http://www.avst.com/products/cx-e/" target="_blank" >CallXpress Product</a>- 
				The code base is close to 30 years old- there are close to 3 million lines of c++ code.</p>
