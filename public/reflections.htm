		<hr/>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it much easier to learn and
		be productive in HTML5 &amp; CSS using just Notepad++. It's free and 
		it has color coding, lots of language specific features and ample plug-ins.
        I tried Komposer but it doesn't do HTML5 very well and text editing is a better
		way to learn</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I experiment with different browsers, I'm 
		becoming more impressed with Microsoft's new Edge browser. It is very lean-
		Chrome used to be lean but it is getting more and more bloated.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing how many developer tools are
		present in the browsers - I love being able to right-click and inspect elements.
		I often play around with style parameters using the Chrome developer tools environment. 
		It is a great way to play around with the elements to interactively explore the 
		effects of changing the style parameters.
